								<h5>I acted as lead designer and developer working with three other UX designers and researchers for this project. I was involved in every process from user research, defining personas, flows and wireframing, to prototyping and UI design. I developed the responsive website independently using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap components.</h5>

                                <h3>The Problem</h3>
								<h5>The Obscure Sound Website was designed to promote emerging quality music and to provide new content from undiscovered artists. We have observed that the outdated design is causing users to leave the website upon arrival. Currently, users are spending around one minute on-site.
                                    How might we redesign Obscure Sound to be contemporary and accessible to increase user engagement time, decrease the bounce rate, and be interactive for the community of music enthusiasts?

                                <h3>The Solution</h3>
								<h5>During our one-to-one interviews and survey, we discovered that most people struggle to find the perfect song or playlist that suits their current mood. Besides redesigning the currend website and making it more accessible and organized, we would develop an applet within the website that allows users to find new music based off of their mood. This will keep users more engaged and will influence them to return to the website as their normal music consumtpion platform.

                                <h3>Research Process</h3>
								<h5>We conducted research by conducting thought out user interviews, user surveys through Google Forums, and conducting a competitor analysis (below)  on other websites with similar goals. We learned that users would greatly value a feature within the website that would keep them captivated. Somethething that would make the website stand out more than just a "blog" website. Through comepetitor analysis, we found that users would constantly revisit a website that can find them new music based on their mood.</h5><br><br>
